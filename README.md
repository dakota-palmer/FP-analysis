# FP-analysis

Fiber photometry analysis pipeline developed with Alexandra Scott for Jocelyn Richard’s Lab at the University of Minnesota. Used for analyses including those reported in Palmer et al., 2023.


##  Overview

### Workflow containing MATLAB, Python, and R code for:

* Combining neuronal recordings, behavioral data, & metadata 
* Preprocessing of photometry signals (downsampling, baseline estimation, artifact elimination)
* Behavioral analyses (focused on Discriminative Stimulus (DS) Task)
* Data visualization & automated figure generation
* Relating neuronal signals to behavior (Peri-event plots, correlations, encoding model, statistical analyses)

### Note about use/adapting:


* As I developed this code over ~4 years, I branched out into other programming languages (Python/R) and improved my programming/data science skills. While I think the code is robust and generalizable, I started this project while learning MATLAB and older code is not super efficient. Early on, I used nonoptimal nested struct organization with many loops. I also manually created and saved a ton of figures  (before learning about packages like gramm/seaborn/ggplot).  Eventually, in MATLAB, converted the inefficient structs into tables which are much easier to work with (see fpStruct2Table.m and fp_manuscript_TidyTable.m scripts). Newer/more recent MATLAB code (e.g. manuscript figure scripts) tends to use tables as well as the gramm package for data visualizations. I recommend going to table/dataframe format ASAP for any new analyses. If I had to do this over again, I’d ditch MATLAB and structs from the beginning and just use Python or R (possibly with relational databases).

* This code can be adapted to other behavioral tasks but many of the variable names/behavioral analyses are currently task-specific (e.g. DS, NS, port-entry (pox), licks (lox)).

     * imports .NEX files, imports session metadata .XLSX sheets → combines into struct → outputs subjDataRaw struct in .mat file
     * Not used in manuscript, but optional initial artifact removal if set artifactRemove=1
          * Uses fpArtifactElimination_DynamicMAD.m 
          * Also, made an interactive MATLAB app to iteratively test parameters/thresholds for artifact elimination- for this, run artifactParameterTest.mlapp

## Additional info: Raw input data, hardware configuration, & data extraction details

### Raw photometry & behavioral event data

* TDT Tanks containing photometry signals and behavioral event timestamps collected using Synapse and the TDT RZ5P data acquisition system

     * Behavioral event timestamps originate from MED Associates TTL pulses 

     * Will be converted to .NEX files using batchTDT2Nex.m  (.NEX) 
     
     * Due to the way that our hardware was set up- there are 2 MED PC boxes per TDT Tank/ .NEX file (1 session per Tank/.NEX file, 2 boxes collected in parallel and combined)

### Session metadata

* Manually-managed metadata spreadsheets
     * Session metadata .xslx sheet
For each recording session, has metadata including identity of Box A, Box B, Subject A, Subject B, training stage, etc.

### Data extraction notes:

This describes the current MATLAB importing/analyses process using TDT's MATLAB SDK. Note that they have other SDKs which you could use if you prefer to go straight to Python, R, etc.


1. Retrieve TDT files for each session- saved locally on recording PC
     
2. **In MatLab**, run TDT2NEX(‘tank filepath’) to generate a .NEX (.NEX5 is disposable)
     * You can use the batchTDT2NEX script to save time with a lot of tanks
     
     * Once you've generated .Nex files, save them and you won't need to do it again- these are the only files you will use for analysis

     * Generating & moving NEX files / TDT data can take a long time- batchTDT2NEX.m will help, but consider doing this on the data collection PC after recording or automating this step somehow

3. Place these .NEX files in a folder along with session metadata spreadsheet .xlsx
     * The metadata .xlsx will provide all session metadata to MatLab for analysis
     * Make sure the metadata .xlsx is up-to-date and accurate with the metadata corresponding to each TDT tank (each .NEX file)
     * Open fpExtractData.m in Matlab
     * Make sure the file paths toward the beginning of the script for the .Nex files and metadata .xlsx are up to date
     * Make sure the indices are correct for the xlsread section- they should correspond to your files of interest
     * Make sure the experiment name string is updated- this will be used to automatically generate filenames for saved plots/variables
     * Run the script. It should load all data in according to the metadata .xlsx
     * The script will loop through each recording session (each nex file within the .nex filepath indicated), associating metadata with it (Subject IDs, training day, training stage etc.)
     * Because of how our recording is setup, data is originally imported in terms of training box (for now, this is either A or B)
     * After looping through each session, data is reorganized by subject (instead of by box) and saved into a struct
     * Data from each session is stored in sesData in terms of recording box and subjData in terms of subject
     * The script will save the subjData struct as a .mat file indcluding the experimentName and date in the filename
